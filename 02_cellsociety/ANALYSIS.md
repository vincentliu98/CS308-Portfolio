Design Review
=======

### Overall Design

* Bullets are made with asterisks

1. You can order things with numbers.

### Your Design

You can put blocks of code in here like this:
```java
    /**
     * Returns sum of all values in given list.
     */
    public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int d : data) {
            total += d;
        }
        return total;
    }
```

### Flexibilty

You can also just write some text

in separate paragraphs.


### Alternate Designs

Here is a graphical look at my design:

![This is cool, too bad you can't see it](online-shopping-uml-example.png "An alternate design")

made from a tool that generates UML from existing code like the
Eclipse plugin [ObjectAid](http://www.objectaid.com/).
