# CompSci 308: Team Review

===================

## Team

### Team Work Environment

[ Focus on how effective you think this team experience was for everyone and what you think made it more/less effective. ]

Additionally, answer the following questions:

#### What were your team's goals for the project and do you think they were clear to everyone?

- Our goal was to create a flexible turn-based strategy game engine. Features of this game genre include sequential turns, the common manipulation of some shared space or model.
- Yes, the goal was clear to everyone.

#### How was work divided among the team members and do you think everyone was clear about their responsibilities?

- Haotian, Vincent, and Amy are responsible for authoring environment's front end.
- Jingchao, Yunhao, and Inchan are responsible for authoring environment's back end.
- Natalie was responsible for creating the engine for backend.
- Johnathan was responsible for creating the front end for the game engine front end.
- Yes, everyone was clear about their responsibilities.

#### How was the communication within the team (was it too much, too little, just right) and why?

- The communication was nearly about right.
- We tried to have big group meeting in the first week but after that the attendence became pretty low due to schedule conflict. We decided to switch our communication to online but sometimes a message can be forgotten.
- Overall, most of us did a good job communicating with each other in different channels on Slack.

#### How clear was the work flow of committing code and how easy did it make sharing progress and why?

- Everytime an individual change is made to the code, the programmer will commit the code. When a feature is finished, then the previous related commits will be merged into the master branch.
- It made sharing easy because whenever we pull from master branch we can check out version control and find out what has been changed.

### Rate Your Teammates

Rate your fellow students as team mates on the following scale:

- -5 (no contribution)
- 0 (not enough information to rate)
- +5 (amazing team leader/designer)

| Student NetID    | Rating          |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| hw186            | +5              |
| ih33             | +5              |
| nl121            | +3              |
| jyn2             | +3              |
| jz192            | +3              |
| yq50             | 0               |
| yk154            | +3              |

#### For each team mate, provide a justification for your evaluation

Focus on people's roles/actions rather than their personal qualities and provide specific examples of those actions.

- hw186
  - Super dedicated member with nearly 400 commits. He is always thinking about how to make a good design for this project
- ih33
  - Highly effective. He made possible the groovy graph and the phase graph and created backend for them. He also did the saving fuction for all the game data.
- nl121
  - Highly effective and organized. She knows what she is doing and was able to take leadership among the team.
- jyn2
  - He created the game engine front end and database. However, he does not usually maintain good communication with the team.
- jz192
  - Highly dedicated. He worked with Haotian to create backend for the authoring environment.
- yq50
  - She did not do much work in the beginning, and when she tried to contribute in later stages it was hard for her to understand what was going on. Therefore, she did some refactoring but did not create many features.
- yk154
  - She worked hard on making the front end work with Haotian. She was in charge of styling and some front end functionalities and design.

## Personal

### My Rating

[ Rate yourself on the same scale as your team mates. Justify your score with specific examples to support your rating. ]

- +3
- Justification: In the beginning stage I was very active in committing new features such as the drag and drop feature. In the later stage I was kind of lost. Despite this, I always maintained good communication with my teammates and made sure the project is going towards a good direction.

### My Role on the Team

[ Describe both your contributions to the project as a whole (such as implementer, designer, facilitator between team mates, debugger) and the code you worked on (such as configuration, or JavaFX or XML expert, or generalist (helped out all over, refactor many pieces of code, etc.)) ]

- I was an implementer and a facilitator between team mates.
- I implemented a basic design for the front end authoring environment and enable drag and drop feature to lay a foundation for the phase graph and the groovy graph. I also enabled the save and load function for the phase graph data.
- In the Slack group I was very active in communicating with my team mates and tried to pursuade them to create a MVP before adding more features.

## Summary

### My biggest strength as a team member

- I enjoy being in a leadership position. When we are creating different parts of the authoring environment, I was able to think from the perspective of product management, judging which feature to prioritize. We ended up prioritizing the functionality rather than the stying and the the look. In this way, I was able to make sure the team is slowly progressing.

### My biggest weakness as a team member

[ YES, everyone has some weaknesses. ]

- I sometimes would overthink. Seeing the immensity of this project, I thought it was nearly impossible to complete, therefore it dimished my confidence a little bit. Thanks to my team mates, especially Inchan, who made good design decisions to make the project work. Otherwise, I would still be overwhelmed.

### How I improved as a team mate this semester

- In the beginning of the course I simply followed whatever others told me because I normally did not know what to do. Later on, I learned some design techniques and became part of the discussions when the team discussed some ideas. I was a ble to give some useful suggestions on making the design better.
- I tried to take on leadership roles in every project. I think my leadership ability has increased through time as I learned to communicate with my team mates.
